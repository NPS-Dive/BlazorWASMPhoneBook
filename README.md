# BlazorWASMPhoneBook
Blazor WASm Phone Book: A simple Sample code with Microfsoft Blazor WebAssembly | By: Dr. Amir Mohammad Shahsavarani | https://www.ipbses.com
In this project I have stepped into the very begining of coding both front- and back-end of a webApp with Blazor.
This webApp utilises Blazor WebAssembly as well as ASP.NET Core as host and Microsoft Entity Framework.
The project simply implements CRUD (Create[post], Read[get], Update, and Delete) methods in the form of a simple phone book.
I will try and do my best in order to update and develop its codes.
Hope yuo too enjoy it.
